# Cloud AI - Animal Classification with Gradio (Frontend) + Vercel.js (Backend API)

This project is part of the Final Project titled **"Design of Animal Classification System Using Deep Learning on Android"**. It implements cloud-based inference using a **Gradio UI hosted on Hugging Face Spaces**, with a **Node.js (Express) API on Vercel** as a backend handler.

---

## üß† Overview

The app allows users to upload animal images and receive classification results across five taxonomy levels:

- **Kelas**
- **Ordo**
- **Famili**
- **Genus**
- **Spesies**

It uses a deep learning CNN model trained for multi-output, multi-class image classification.

## üåê Project Structure

### Gradio UI (Frontend on Hugging Face)

Located in `/deploy/` folder:

| File                   | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `app.py`               | FastAPI app + Gradio interface |
| `D3(4HL+0.2D).h5`      | Best-performing Keras model |
| `M3(4HL+0.2D).h5`      | Lightweight TFLite-compatible model |
| `label_encodings.json` | Mapping for label indices to taxonomy names |
| `requirements.txt`     | Python dependencies for Hugging Face Space |
| `README.md`            | This file |

### Node.js Backend API (Vercel)

Located in root project folder:

| File             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `index.js`       | Express server for proxying Gradio API requests |
| `package.json`   | Project metadata and dependencies |
| `vercel.json`    | Vercel configuration file |
| `node_modules/`  | Node.js dependencies |
| `.gitignore`     | Git ignore list |
| `README.md`      | This file |

## üöÄ Deployment

### Gradio App (Hugging Face)
1. Go to [https://huggingface.co/spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and create a new **Gradio** space.
2. Upload contents of `deploy/` folder.
3. Ensure `app.py` runs the Gradio interface and uses `launch()`.

Example Gradio code:
```python
import gradio as gr
def classify_image(image): ...
gr.Interface(fn=classify_image, inputs="image", outputs="label").launch()
```

### Vercel Backend API (Node.js)
1. Install Vercel CLI and login.
2. From project root, deploy with:
```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```
3. Ensure `vercel.json` routes requests correctly to `index.js`.

---

## üîÑ Example Usage

1. User uploads image on Gradio UI.
2. Gradio sends request to FastAPI model.
3. Vercel backend can optionally be used by Android app to proxy request to Gradio or perform additional processing.

---

## üìö Use Case

Designed for mobile integration as cloud inference alternative. Useful when direct Hugging Face calls are restricted or additional backend logic is required. It promotes public understanding of animal taxonomy and conservation.
